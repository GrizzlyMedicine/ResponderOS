| Eyewear Allowance | Often included in Medicare Advantage plans (amount and frequency vary by plan) | $175 every other year (ages 21+), annually (under 21) |
| Medically Necessary Eye Care | Covered under Original Medicare (e.g., cataract surgery) | Included under general medical care coverage |
| Age Restrictions | None for general vision benefits | Specific allowances and frequencies based on age |
Durable Medical Equipment (DME) coverage under Aetna Medicare: definition and covered items
Under Aetna Medicare, Durable Medical Equipment (DME) is generally defined as equipment that is durable and reusable, primarily and customarily used for a medical purpose, generally not useful to a person in the absence of illness or injury, and appropriate for use in a patient's home . This equipment is expected to last for at least three years . Common examples of DME covered by Medicare include wheelchairs and scooters, hospital beds, oxygen equipment, and diabetic supplies . However, items that are primarily for comfort or convenience, or equipment that is typically used outside of the home, are generally not covered as DME . Medicare Part B provides coverage for DME when it is determined to be medically necessary and is prescribed by a physician . It's also important to note that certain types of DME may require prior authorization from Aetna Medicare before coverage is approved .
Assistive technology coverage under Aetna Medicare
While the term "assistive technology" appears in Aetna Medicare documentation , the policy details for a broad range of assistive technology devices are not explicitly outlined as a separate category in the provided snippets. Instead, Medicare tends to categorize assistive technologies that meet the definition under the umbrella of DME. One notable example is Speech Generating Devices (SGDs), which are considered DME and may be covered for individuals who have severe speech impairments that warrant the use of such a device . Additionally, basic mobility aids like canes, quad canes, and crutches are also covered as DME if specific medical necessity criteria are met, particularly concerning limitations in performing mobility-related activities of daily living (MRADLs) within the home . Similarly, wheelchairs and scooters are classified as DME, with coverage contingent upon demonstrating medical necessity related to an individual's inability to ambulate independently within their home .
Coverage for devices combining vision correction and medical alert/communication features under Aetna Medicare
Aetna Medicare Advantage plans often offer integrated benefits that include vision coverage alongside other services . These vision benefits typically focus on routine eye examinations and allowances for purchasing standard prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. However, the available information does not explicitly mention any specific coverage policies within Aetna Medicare for devices that combine vision correction with advanced medical alert or communication features in a single wearable device like the Halliday AI glasses. While Medicare Advantage plans aim to provide more comprehensive benefits, the primary emphasis of their vision coverage appears to be on addressing routine vision needs rather than covering technologically advanced devices with additional health-related functionalities.
Medical necessity criteria for DME under Aetna Medicare and its applicability to the Halliday AI glasses
For Durable Medical Equipment (DME) to be covered under Aetna Medicare, it must meet specific criteria for medical necessity. This generally means the equipment must be used for a medical reason, be durable, used in the patient's home, and typically only be useful to someone who is sick or injured . For mobility aids such as canes, walkers, and wheelchairs, medical necessity is often determined by whether the individual has a significant impairment in their ability to perform Mobility-Related Activities of Daily Living (MRADLs) within their home environment . In the case of Speech Generating Devices (SGDs), medical necessity involves a diagnosis of a permanent severe expressive speech disability where the individual's communication needs cannot be adequately met through natural methods of communication . Even for items like hospital beds, specific medical conditions requiring body positioning, special attachments, or significant head elevation are necessary to meet the criteria for coverage . To argue for the medical necessity of the Halliday AI glasses under Medicare, the user would need to demonstrate that the notification features are crucial for managing their disability and performing essential daily activities within their home, similar to how other covered DME addresses specific medical needs. The vision correction aspect, while important for the user's overall well-being, is less likely to be the primary factor in a DME coverage determination under Original Medicare.
Coverage pathways for innovative or emerging medical technologies under Aetna Medicare
Aetna Medicare plans may offer benefits related to emerging medical technologies, such as telehealth services that allow members to access healthcare providers virtually . Furthermore, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has established a Transitional Coverage for Emerging Technologies (TCET) pathway . This pathway is designed for certain medical devices that have received FDA Breakthrough Device designation, aiming to provide more timely and predictable access to these innovative technologies for Medicare beneficiaries . The TCET pathway utilizes the existing National Coverage Determination (NCD) and Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) processes to expedite coverage for these designated devices . Medicare Advantage plans also have the flexibility to include additional benefits beyond those offered by Original Medicare, which could potentially encompass innovative medical technologies if they are deemed medically necessary and cost-effective .
Analysis of Aetna Medicaid (Texas) Coverage

This can include a wide spectrum of devices, from low-tech options like handheld magnifiers and canes to high-tech equipment such as specialized computer hardware and software . Furthermore, Texas Medicaid recognizes the importance of assistive technology services, which can include assessing an individual's need for assistive technology, training the person and their family or caregivers on its use, and providing for the fitting, adaptation, maintenance, and repair of assistive technology devices . Aetna also emphasizes its commitment to accessibility and complies with federal civil rights laws by providing free aids and services, including assistive technology support, to people with disabilities . The STAR Kids program, which serves children and adults up to age 20 with disabilities, also encompasses coverage for various assistive technologies as part of its comprehensive Medicaid benefits .
Coverage for devices combining vision correction and medical alert/communication features under Aetna Medicaid (Texas)
While the standard vision care benefits under Aetna Medicaid in Texas primarily focus on routine eye examinations and allowances for standard eyeglasses or contact lenses , there is no explicit mention of coverage for devices that integrate vision correction with medical alert or communication features within these standard vision benefits. However, the inclusion of "augmentative and assistive communication devices" as a covered category under Durable Medical Equipment (DME) in Texas Medicaid  presents a potential avenue for coverage. If the primary function and medical necessity of a device like the Halliday AI glasses can be attributed to its communication and medical alert capabilities for an individual with a disability, then it might be considered for coverage under this DME category, even if it also provides vision correction through prescription lenses.
Medical necessity criteria for DME under Aetna Medicaid (Texas) and its applicability to the Halliday AI glasses
Under Aetna Medicaid (Texas), the overarching criterion for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) coverage is that the equipment must be medically necessary for the member . For specific categories of DME, such as mobility aids like wheelchairs, the medical necessity is often tied to a significant limitation in performing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) within the home environment . In the context of augmentative and assistive communication devices, which are covered under DME in Texas Medicaid, the medical necessity would relate to the individual's communication impairment and the device's demonstrated ability to effectively address those specific communication needs . The Texas Medicaid Provider Manual also indicates some flexibility in addressing the unique needs of individuals with disabilities through flexible benefit options for disability-related services, including personal care support and skilled care . To establish medical necessity for the Halliday AI glasses, the user would need to clearly articulate how their disability necessitates the specific notification features provided by the glasses, effectively demonstrating that these features function as a critical assistive communication tool essential for their health, safety, and overall well-being, especially in light of the lost notification watch.

Aetna as an organization has expressed a commitment to accessibility and aims to create inclusive digital experiences, even involving assistive technology users in their innovation processes .
Potential Coverage Arguments and Challenges
Arguments for classifying Halliday AI glasses as DME or assistive technology under both Medicare and Medicaid, focusing on the notification features as medically necessary due to your disability
Under Aetna Medicare, an argument could be made that the notification feature of the Halliday AI glasses functions as a critical medical alert system, similar in purpose to other covered DME that supports an individual's health and safety. The loss of the notification watch has created a demonstrable gap in the user's ability to receive timely alerts related to their disability, and the glasses could be seen as medically necessary to restore this essential function. While the device also provides vision correction, the primary driver for seeking coverage through DME would be the critical need for these alerts.
For Aetna Medicaid (Texas), the most compelling argument lies in classifying the Halliday AI glasses as an "augmentative and assistive communication device," which is explicitly covered under DME. The notification feature directly addresses the user's need to receive timely medical alerts and important communications, a fundamental aspect of communication that is particularly vital for individuals with disabilities. The fact that the glasses also provide prescription vision correction can be presented as an additional, integrated benefit of a device that is primarily needed for essential communication support due to the user's disability.
Potential challenges in obtaining coverage, such as the integration of vision correction with notification features and the "comfort or convenience" exclusion for DME
Under Aetna Medicare, a significant challenge will be fitting the Halliday AI glasses into an existing DME category, as standard eyeglasses are typically excluded. The integration of vision correction might lead to the perception that the device is primarily a vision aid with added features. Furthermore, the "comfort or convenience" exclusion for DME could be applied to the notification feature unless a robust argument for medical necessity is presented, clearly demonstrating that these alerts are not merely a matter of preference but a critical requirement due to the user's disability. The requirement that DME is typically used in the home might also be a point of contention, as the user would likely benefit from the notification features in various settings.
For Aetna Medicaid (Texas), while the explicit coverage of assistive communication devices is a positive factor, insurers might argue that the primary function of the Halliday AI glasses is vision correction, with the notification being a secondary, non-essential feature. The cost of the device compared to standard eyeglasses and more basic notification methods could also pose a challenge. Justifying the necessity of a high-tech integrated solution over potentially lower-cost alternatives will be an important aspect of making a successful claim.
