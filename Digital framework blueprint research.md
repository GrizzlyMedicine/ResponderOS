Integrated Digital Personhood System: Technical Blueprint

  

Memory Architecture

  

Design the system’s memory as a hybrid of vector-based embeddings and a knowledge graph to capture unstructured experiences and structured facts, respectively. A stateless vector database stores high-dimensional embeddings of content (text, images, audio), enabling semantic similarity search at scale. For example, after a conversation or observation, the system can generate an embedding and write it to the vector DB. Later, when a related query arises, it embeds the query and finds the nearest stored vectors to retrieve relevant memory snippets . This yields low-latency recall of semantically similar content even with large memory stores (thanks to ANN indexes like HNSW or IVF). To ensure performance, enable vector indices on the embedding field and use filtering for context (many vector DBs support metadata filters alongside similarity search).

  

In parallel, maintain a knowledge graph (KG) for structured relational memory. The KG stores facts and relationships (as nodes and edges or RDF triples) – for example, entities like Person A –knows→Person B or emotional tags like Event X –triggers→Feeling:happy. This graph allows precise queries and logical reasoning (e.g. find connections between concepts or track state changes). Integrating the two memory systems: use cross-references between them. For instance, each vector memory item can include an ID or URI that links to a node in the knowledge graph (if the memory is about a known entity or event). Conversely, when a KG node has associated documentation (e.g. a biography text), store an embedding of that text in the vector DB for semantic lookup. This way, an agent can retrieve a memory by similarity, then follow the link to get structured facts, or vice-versa. Such a combination allows both fuzzy recall and exact logical queries. Research shows that pairing LLM embeddings with a knowledge graph yields more precise, context-rich results – the vector search gives relevant context, while the KG provides verifiable facts around the query .

  

Open-source options: For the vector database, use a performant ANN search library or service. Good choices include FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for an in-memory index, or vector DB servers like Qdrant, Milvus, or Weaviate – all open-source and optimized in C++/Rust for low latency. These support billions of vectors with millisecond search on CPU and can run in a Docker container. (If you prefer a turnkey solution, the Convex database’s vector index is another option, as used in AI Town , but one can achieve similar results with the above libraries without vendor lock-in.) For the knowledge graph, use an open-source graph database or triple store: Neo4j Community Edition (property graph DB), Apache Jena or Fuseki (RDF store), or ArangoDB (multi-model with graph and document support) are viable. These can run on the same machine in an LXC or Docker. Keep the KG schema simple and focused on the domain of your AI (e.g. nodes for people, goals, memories, and edges for relations like friend-of, subtask-of, causes). Best practices: periodically compress or summarize old vector memories to conserve space (e.g. store a summary embedding for very old events), and enforce consistency between the KG and vectors (when a fact is updated in the KG, also update or invalidate related embeddings). This dual memory architecture – a vector recall for experiences and a graph for core knowledge – provides both richness and precision in the agent’s long-term memory.

  

Agent Orchestration

  

Coordinate cognition across multiple specialized sub-agents using an orchestration framework. Agency Swarm will serve as the high-level manager of a “swarm” of agents, each with a distinct role (analogous to specialized brain regions or processes), while OctoTools provides structured tool-usage and planning capabilities within agents.

  

Agency Swarm setup: Define each sub-agent with a role and description (e.g. a SensoryAgent that interprets raw inputs, an EmotionalAgent that assigns emotional valence, a CognitiveAgent that plans and reasons). Agency Swarm allows grouping these agents into an Agency and managing their interactions. Crucially, it supports asynchronous, parallel messaging – meaning agents can work concurrently and communicate without blocking. To enable this, configure the Agency to use the asynchronous messaging class. For example, when instantiating your agency:

from agency_swarm import Agency, SendMessageAsyncThreading

agency = Agency(agents=[cog_agent, sensory_agent, emotional_agent],

                send_message_tool_class=SendMessageAsyncThreading)

This setting runs each agent’s message-handling in a separate thread . In practice, if the Cognitive agent needs input from the Emotional agent, it can send a message and continue working on other things; the Emotional agent’s response will come later (the framework provides a callback or the ability to poll for the reply). This models biological parallelism – e.g. the “emotional reflex” agent can process stimuli at the same time as the cognitive reasoning agent. You can also configure async tools similarly (by setting ToolConfig.async_mode="threading" on time-consuming tools) so an agent can launch, say, a long-running web search tool in parallel with another calculation . Agency Swarm handles a shared context via an in-memory shared state dict (accessible by all agents) for simple coordination (e.g. the Sensory agent can drop a parsed result in shared_state for others to use). This avoids constant message passing for certain global info. Each agent in the swarm should have a clear prompt template defining its persona and scope, and Agency Swarm lets you fully customize these prompts (no hidden system prompts), giving you transparency and control.

  

OctoTools for structured reasoning: OctoTools will function as a reasoning and tool orchestration layer, which you can integrate with Agency Swarm’s agents. OctoTools introduces “Tool Cards” – metadata wrappers for tools (APIs, functions, etc.) that describe how to use them (inputs/outputs, usage guidelines) . It uses a Planner module (powered by an LLM) that takes an objective and breaks it into sub-tasks, deciding which tools or skills to invoke for each step. The plan is essentially a text-based outline of steps or function calls. Then an Action Predictor refines each step with the specific tool and parameters needed, and a Command Generator produces actual executable code to call that tool. Finally, a Command Executor runs the code, and a Verifier checks the results, feeding back into the LLM if something failed, while a Summarizer consolidates the final answer . In practical terms, this means an agent equipped with OctoTools can take a complex query (“Tell me how to do X, then Y with result, and summarize”) and internally plan: step 1 – use tool A, step 2 – use tool B, etc., without hard-coding that logic. OctoTools emphasizes reliability by separating planning from execution, which reduces errors and makes debugging easier (you can inspect the intermediate plan and commands).

  

Using them together: Agency Swarm will manage multiple agents working concurrently, and OctoTools will manage multi-step tool use and reasoning within an agent. For example, the Cognitive agent can leverage OctoTools to plan a complex task, calling various tools (including asking other agents) as sub-steps. Meanwhile, the Sensory and Emotional agents run in parallel, perhaps triggered by incoming data or by the Cognitive agent’s requests. Agency Swarm routes messages: e.g. Cognitive agent -> Emotional agent: “How do I feel about this event?”; Emotional agent uses its logic (or even a simple lookup or ML model) and replies; Agency Swarm delivers the response back asynchronously to Cognitive agent. All the while, the Cognitive agent might also be calling the memory vector search tool or external APIs via OctoTools. This decentralized orchestration means each module focuses on its specialty (sensing, feeling, planning, etc.) but they share context through the orchestrator. Agency Swarm also supports custom communication flows if you need to implement specific message routing (beyond the default “any agent can message any other”). In summary, Agency Swarm provides the infrastructure for an agent society with messaging, state, and concurrency controls, and OctoTools provides a powerful brains for any agent that needs to orchestrate tools or complex reasoning steps. Together, they enable the kind of parallel, context-aware cognition hypothesized – akin to different brain regions processing in tandem and communicating results asynchronously.

  

Integration & Coding

  

Now we integrate memory, orchestration, agents, and tools into a cohesive system. The architecture will consist of modular components that interact through well-defined APIs or message-passing. Here’s how to put the pieces together:

  

1. Connecting to the Vector DB and Knowledge Graph: Implement a memory interface that the agents can use to store and query memories. For example, use a client library (Python) for your chosen vector DB (e.g. qdrant-client, weaviate-client) and for your graph DB (e.g. Neo4j’s neo4j Python driver or an HTTP endpoint for a RDF store). Wrap these in simple functions or classes – e.g. MemoryStore.add(text) that returns an ID after embedding the text and upserting into the vector DB, and MemoryStore.query(similar_to_text) that returns top-N similar chunks with their IDs. Similarly, a KnowledgeGraph.query(entity or relation) function can run a Cypher or SPARQL query and return results. These will be used by specialized tools or agents. It’s wise to keep the memory layer stateless relative to the agents – i.e. the agents call the APIs each time they need info, rather than holding large memories in RAM. This ensures consistency (all agents see the same updated memory) and scalability (the DBs can be optimized independently).

  

2. Implementing Tools as Agents or Functions: Decide how agents will access the above memory functions and other external actions. In Agency Swarm, you can create Tool classes (subclasses of BaseTool) that an agent can call via the Assistants API (function calling interface). For example, define a MemorySearchTool with a run(self, query: str) -> list[str] method that embeds the query and calls MemoryStore.query() to get relevant snippets. Register this tool with the agents that need it (likely the Cognitive agent). Do the same for a KnowledgeGraphTool that can fetch or assert facts (maybe query_facts(self, entity) returning a summary of that entity’s info from the KG). With OctoTools, the process is similar but using Tool Cards: you’d create a tool card for memory search (including description, input/output schema) so the OctoTools planner knows it can use a “MemorySearch” action in plans. In code, that might be as simple as providing a Python function and some JSON/YAML metadata for the tool to OctoTools’ registry. Ensure each tool is idempotent and side-effect free (or clearly documented), since the agent might call them multiple times or in parallel.

  

3. Defining the Agents: Using Agency Swarm’s API, define each agent with its role name, initial prompt (system message), and the tools it can use. For instance:

from agency_swarm import Agent, BaseTool

  

class MemorySearchTool(BaseTool):

    # define input/output schema if needed, then:

    def run(self, query:str):

        return memory_store.query(query)  # returns e.g. list of relevant texts

  

memory_tool = MemorySearchTool(name="MemorySearch")

# Define the cognitive agent with access to memory and knowledge tools

cognitive_agent = Agent(

    name="CognitiveAgent",

    system_message="You are the core reasoning agent with access to memory and knowledge.",

    tools=[memory_tool, knowledge_tool, planning_tool]  # planning_tool could interface OctoTools

)

# Define other agents (sensory, emotional) perhaps with simpler behaviors or limited toolsets

emotional_agent = Agent(

    name="EmotionalAgent",

    system_message="You evaluate the emotional tone of situations and provide affective feedback."

    # this agent might use a simple sentiment analysis tool or none, and mainly returns feelings

)

sensory_agent = Agent(

    name="SensoryAgent",

    system_message="You interpret sensory inputs (images, audio) into text descriptions for the cognitive agent."

    # this agent could have a vision tool (e.g. an image captioning model) if needed

)

Each agent’s system_message acts as the persona and instructions. You can also provide example dialogs (few-shot) if that helps consistency. Registering tools like this means when the agent is “thinking” (LLM generating an assistant message), it can decide to call a tool by name (via function calling). Agency Swarm will intercept that and call your run method, then return the result to the agent’s context. This allows, say, the Cognitive agent to seamlessly invoke a memory search mid-dialogue.

  

4. Orchestrating Inter-agent Communication: Instantiate an Agency with these agents: agency = Agency([cognitive_agent, emotional_agent, sensory_agent], send_message_tool_class=SendMessageAsyncThreading). Now the Cognitive agent can send a message to the Emotional agent by calling a special tool (Agency Swarm provides a SendMessage tool automatically to agents for inter-agent comms). For example, within the Cognitive agent’s prompt or logic it might say: “<send_message agent='EmotionalAgent'>The user just said: "I lost my wallet". How should we feel?</send_message>”. Agency Swarm will route this to the EmotionalAgent and get the reply (“I feel worry and empathy…”), which the Cognitive agent can use in its final answer. This is abstracted through the Assistants API function calling, so in code it’s just the LLM choosing the send_message function with target agent. Because we enabled async mode, the Cognitive agent doesn’t freeze while waiting – it could simultaneously call a memory tool or start formulating part of an answer. The framework handles synchronizing the eventual responses . Internally, you might use the shared_state to post a sensory agent’s output (e.g. transcription of audio) that the cognitive agent then picks up – this is another way to integrate outputs without explicit messaging . Design the communication patterns that make sense for your use case (e.g. Cognitive queries Emotional for sentiment on each user input, or Emotional interrupts if something triggers a strong emotion). These parallel, asynchronous exchanges allow the system to mimic the concurrent processes in a human mind.

  

5. Integrating the Language Model & External APIs: All agents will use an LLM to generate their responses or thoughts. Rather than a closed API, use a local or open-source model to avoid paywalls. For instance, you can run a 7B-13B parameter model (like Llama 2, GPT4All-J, or OpenAssistant) on the MacBook Air M2 (which has a decent Neural Engine/GPU for such models) or on a hosted GPU via HuggingFace. One approach is to set up an OpenAI-compatible API wrapper for a local model – projects like Astra or Open Assistant API provide endpoints that mimic OpenAI’s chat/completion API, which Agency Swarm can use out-of-the-box . This means you can point the orchestrator at http://<your_macbook>:8000/v1/chat/completions (for example) and get responses from your local model as if it were OpenAI. HuggingFace’s transformers library or Text Generation Inference server can also serve a model via REST or sockets. HuggingFace Spaces is an option to host a model inference endpoint freely: you could deploy a smaller model in a Space and call its API (though for speed and privacy, running locally on the M2 is likely better). In code, configure the Agency Swarm or OctoTools LLM backend to use your chosen endpoint (Agency Swarm’s docs show using an .env to set API base URL and key for custom models). Also integrate any other external tools via API – e.g. if you want a web search tool, you can use an API like Wikipedia or an open web scraper. Define a tool (or OctoTools card) for it (taking a query and returning results). The OctoTools planner might then include steps like “use WebSearchTool” in its plan when needed. By registering these tools, you give the agents the ability to perform actions in the world (internet searches, calculations, etc.) beyond just recalling internal knowledge. This modular approach means you can plug in new tools as they become available (for instance, if you add a speech synthesis module, you could have an agent that turns text to speech on the iPhone).

  

6. Modular code structure: Organize your codebase for clarity and scalability. For example, have separate modules/files for: memory.py (handling the vector and graph DB connections, with functions like store_memory, query_memory, query_knowledge), agents.py (defining Agent classes or configurations for each role, and their tools), tools.py (implementations of BaseTool or any OctoTools tool functions), and a main orchestrator script (main.py) that ties it together (initializes the DB connections, loads agents, starts the Agency loop or server). Use environment variables or config files for credentials (e.g. graph DB auth, HuggingFace API tokens) rather than hardcoding. This structure makes it easy to swap components – for instance, if you change the vector DB from Qdrant to Weaviate, only memory.py needs updating. Aim to keep each agent’s design independent; they should communicate only via messages or shared memory, not by directly calling each other’s functions (to preserve the decoupling and statelessness). Logging and debugging info can be added in a utils.py or via decorators on tool calls, which is helpful to trace the chain of thoughts during development.

  

By following this integration strategy, you connect the long-term memory (vector and KG) with the agents (via tools) and coordinate everything through the Agency Swarm orchestrator. The Cognitive agent effectively becomes a central executive that can consult memories, talk to other agents, and use tools (with OctoTools ensuring complex sequences are handled rigorously). The Sensory and Emotional agents provide specialized processing that runs concurrently, feeding into the cognitive loop as needed – analogous to how humans process visual input or emotional reactions in parallel with conscious reasoning. All components communicate through well-defined interfaces (function calls, message passing), making it easier to maintain and extend the system.

  

Deployment Considerations

  

The target deployment is on readily available consumer hardware – specifically a 2017 i5 27” iMac (5K) as a server (with Proxmox virtualization), and auxiliary devices (a MacBook Air M2 and an iPhone 15 Pro Max) for additional computing and interface. We need to optimize for the constraints of this setup (CPU-bound computation, limited RAM, no dedicated GPU on iMac) while ensuring modular scalability.

  

Proxmox + LXC Containerization: Using Proxmox on the iMac, allocate separate LXC containers (or lightweight VMs) for each major service to isolate resources and simplify management. For example, create one container for the Vector Database (running Qdrant or Milvus). These DBs can be started via Docker within the LXC or directly installed – e.g. run a Qdrant Docker image and expose its port. Another container can host the Knowledge Graph database (for Neo4j, an LXC with 4-8GB RAM and its Java runtime would be suitable, or a smaller one for an RDF store). Next, have an Orchestrator container – an LXC that runs the Python environment for Agency Swarm and OctoTools. This container will contain your code (agents.py, etc.) and you can start the orchestrator as a systemd service or a simple background process. If you use n8n (which you mentioned is already running) for workflow automation, keep that in a separate container (as it likely is) – n8n can then interact via HTTP with the orchestrator (e.g., trigger certain agent actions on schedules or pipe external data in). An Obsidian container might not be needed unless you run a headless Obsidian for syncing notes; more practically, you can just share a folder from the host into the orchestrator container to give it access to your Obsidian vault (if you want the agent to read your notes). Ensure each LXC has appropriate CPU and memory limits – e.g. the vector DB container might need 2 cores and a couple GB RAM for efficient indexing, the graph DB similarly, and the orchestrator container can be given the rest for running the LLM and agents.

  

MacBook Air M2 as an AI accelerator: The M2 is much more capable for ML workloads (Apple’s silicon has a fast neural engine and GPU). You can offload the heavy model inference to the MacBook to keep the iMac (i5) free for orchestrating and database tasks. For instance, run a local LLM server on the MacBook – you could use llama.cpp with a quantized model and start it in server mode (it can serve requests over HTTP or gRPC), or use something like the Text Generation Web UI with API enabled. The Agency Swarm on the iMac can then call this API for generating responses. This way, the iMac handles memory queries (which are lightweight CPU ops) and coordinating agents, while the MacBook handles the brunt of generating text with the neural engine – an optimal division. Connect them via your local network (ensure the MacBook’s IP/port is reachable from the iMac’s containers – you might need to adjust Proxmox network settings or use bridged networking for the LXCs). If the MacBook is not always on, an alternative is to utilize HuggingFace Inference API or Spaces for model inference on demand, but the latency will be higher and internet-dependent. For scaling, you could even split different models: e.g. a smaller model on the iMac for the Emotional agent (since sentiment analysis can be a tiny model) and a larger one on M2 for the Cognitive agent.

  

iPhone 15 Pro Max as interface and sensor: The iPhone can serve both as a user interface to the AI and a sensor provider. For UI, you can create a simple shortcut or app that records your voice or text input and sends it via HTTP to the orchestrator’s REST API (you might set up a small Flask/FastAPI server in the orchestrator container to accept queries). The response can be sent back as text and the iPhone can even speak it using AVSpeechSynthesizer for a voice assistant feel. This gives you a “personal assistant” interface on the phone, backed by the cloud of agents on the iMac/MacBook. Additionally, the iPhone’s sensors (camera, microphone) can feed the system: you might take a photo, send it to the Sensory agent (the orchestrator can route it to an image-captioning tool or a vision model on the MacBook or a HuggingFace API), and get a description which is then used by the Cognitive agent. Although the iPhone has a powerful chip (A17) capable of running some models (CoreML models, etc.), doing heavy AI on the phone might drain battery and is unnecessary since you have the other hardware. So, leverage the phone mainly for input/output and mobility, while computation remains on the iMac/MacBook.

  

Performance optimization: Given the iMac’s older CPU, avoid running any large models or exhaustive computations on it. Use quantized embeddings (e.g. use 384-dimensional MiniLM embeddings instead of 1024-dim if it meets your semantic needs) to speed up similarity search and reduce memory. The vector DB queries can be made very fast with HNSW indexing – ensure those indexes are built and reside in memory. For the knowledge graph, restrict queries to what’s needed (you can design the agent to ask for specific info, like one or two-hop relations, rather than pulling huge subgraphs). Caching is your friend: cache embeddings of frequent inputs (Agency Swarm’s docs even mention caching embeddings ). If the same chunk of text is fed often, store its vector so you don’t recompute. Also cache tool results if appropriate (e.g. if the user asks the same question twice, avoid redoing the entire sequence). Another tip is to use streaming generation for the LLM responses (Agency Swarm supports streaming tokens to the client ) – this won’t make the total time faster, but it improves the responsiveness (the user sees partial output while the agent is still formulating the rest). On the MacBook’s LLM server, enable int8 or int4 quantization to run models faster with minimal quality loss. If even that is slow, consider using a smaller model for real-time interaction and only using a larger model for very complex tasks (the orchestrator could decide: if query is simple, use a 7B model; if it’s a tough problem, call a 13B model and accept slower answer).

  

Modularity and scalability: The use of containers means you can swap components (e.g., upgrade the vector DB to a newer version by replacing its container) without affecting others. It also allows scaling out: in the future, if you get access to a more powerful server, you could move the memory DBs there and just point your agents to the new address. The architecture supports adding more agents as well – you might add a PlanningAgent separate from the Cognitive one, or a CreativityAgent for brainstorming, etc. Thanks to Agency Swarm, they can all communicate as needed. Just be mindful of the iMac’s CPU – each additional concurrent LLM agent will add load. You might limit concurrency or schedule agents’ activities to avoid thrashing the CPU. Using the MacBook offloads a lot, but the iMac will still handle the coordination logic (which fortunately is mostly I/O bound waiting for responses, not heavy computation).

  

In summary, deploy core persistent services (databases, orchestrator) on the iMac under Proxmox for always-on availability. Leverage the MacBook M2 for computationally intensive model inference by setting up a local API. Use the iPhone for a convenient user-facing client to the system. All components communicate over your LAN, keeping latency low and avoiding internet reliance (except when using external data or models from HuggingFace). This setup is cost-effective and private, using hardware you own and open-source software, yet it remains flexible – you can swap in new models or move components to cloud instances if needed later, with minimal changes to the code.

  

Accessibility & Democratization

  

A key goal is that this “digital personhood” AI is built entirely from free or open-source components, making it accessible and reproducible by others without proprietary dependencies. We consciously avoid paywalled APIs or services. Here are the choices that ensure democratization:

• LLM and AI Models: Use open models available on Hugging Face (e.g. Llama 2, Falcon, Mistral, GPT4All variants) instead of closed models. These can be run locally or via the HuggingFace Hub. If using HuggingFace’s hosted inference, prefer HuggingFace Spaces or the free Inference API for community models. For example, the OpenAssistant 13B model can be deployed in a Space and accessed with simple REST calls – completely free. Agency Swarm even provides integration for OpenAI-like APIs backed by open models , which we utilized via Astra or similar, so the swap from OpenAI to local is seamless. All the frameworks (Agency Swarm, OctoTools) are model-agnostic; they don’t require OpenAI specifically.

• Orchestration Frameworks: Both Agency Swarm and OctoTools are open-source (MIT license for Agency Swarm, and a similarly permissive license for OctoTools). No licensing fees or cloud hooks are required – you install them via pip or GitHub. We use Agency Swarm’s offline mode (with open models) to avoid any need for an OpenAI API key. OctoTools likewise operates locally with your chosen LLM as the backbone for planning.

• Memory Stores: The chosen vector database and graph database are open-source (for example, Qdrant is Apache-2.0 licensed, Neo4j Community is GPL, etc.). They can run locally without subscriptions. If one were to use a managed service for convenience, there are free tiers (like Pinecone has a free tier, or Neo4j AuraDB free tier), but our blueprint assumes self-hosting to avoid any service dependency.

• Tools and External APIs: Wherever possible, use free APIs or offline tools. For web search, you might use the Wikimedia API (free and open) or an open-source search index. For text-to-speech, use an offline TTS engine (e.g. Coqui TTS or even macOS built-in TTS). For OCR or vision, use open-source libraries (Tesseract OCR, OpenCV, etc.). This ensures the agent’s capabilities don’t require paid SaaS subscriptions. The iPhone interface can be done with the Shortcuts app (which is free on iOS) or a simple SwiftUI app you write – no need for proprietary apps.

• Community resources and support: You can take advantage of community hubs like HuggingFace and GitHub for pre-trained models and code. For instance, HuggingFace hosts many Spaces demonstrating multi-agent systems – you could adapt those (they’re all open-source code) to your needs. By keeping everything open, the project can get contributions from others and validate the hypothesis in a transparent way.

  

A nice side effect of using only free components is that anyone with similar hardware can replicate this setup, fostering community experimentation. There’s no hidden algorithm – the knowledge graph can even be built from open datasets (or your personal data), the models are inspectable, and the agent prompts are under your control. This democratizes “person-like AI” development, moving it out of the exclusive domain of big tech. It’s important to document your configuration and share any tweaks (for example, if you fine-tune a smaller model for better emotional responses, you could share that model on HuggingFace for others). In spirit, this project aligns with open-source AI assistant efforts (like OpenAssistant, PrivateGPT, etc.), demonstrating that with some integration effort, a fully self-hosted digital being is feasible today.

  

Blueprint Integration

  

Finally, we outline a step-by-step integration roadmap to build and verify the complete system, and provide an architectural diagram of the components and data flow:

1. Environment Setup: Prepare the iMac/Proxmox server with the necessary containers. Install the vector database (e.g. run Qdrant or Milvus Docker image) and graph database (e.g. Neo4j or a RDF store) in separate containers and confirm they are accessible (e.g. Qdrant on port 6333, Neo4j on 7687 for Bolt or 7474 for HTTP). Install Python (3.10+) in the orchestrator container along with needed libraries: agency-swarm, octotools, transformers (for model/embedding), qdrant-client (or others), networkx or appropriate client for the KG, etc. Ensure the MacBook (if used for models) has a server setup (e.g. install llama.cpp and test generating text locally, or set up an API). This step is about getting all infrastructure pieces up and running independently.

2. Memory Initialization: Populate the initial memory structures. If you have existing knowledge (e.g. an Obsidian vault of notes or background documents the AI should “remember”), ingest them now. For each document or note, compute an embedding (e.g. using a local Transformer model like all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and upsert into the vector DB with an ID and metadata (source, date, etc.). Also, insert key facts into the knowledge graph – for example, add nodes for yourself (the user), important people or concepts from the notes, etc., and link them (if your notes have structure, you can automate this, otherwise do a few manually to give the KG a starter set). This simulates the AI’s long-term memory acquired during “training” (even though here we’re not training the model, just storing info). Verify that you can query the vector DB (try a test query and see if you get relevant results) and the KG (run a sample query for a node).

3. Define Agent Roles & Prompts: Decide on the sub-agents and create their profiles. For instance, define:

• Cognitive Agent: Role – “central thinker/planner,” given a prompt like “You are the core reasoning unit of the AI, responsible for planning and decision-making. You can talk to other agents and use tools to answer the user.”

• Sensory Agent: Role – “perception,” prompt like “You interpret input from the user or environment (images, audio) into text descriptions.”

• Emotional Agent: Role – “affective response,” prompt like “You monitor the conversation and events to produce an emotional state or reaction (happy, sad, concerned, excited) which will influence responses.”

• (Optional) Memory Agent: You might not need a separate memory agent if the cognitive agent directly uses tools, but you could have one that solely manages storage – e.g. an agent that writes important new facts to the knowledge graph or summarizes the day’s chat.

These prompts will be the system messages for each agent in Agency Swarm. Keep them concise but clear about capabilities. Also prepare any example dialogues (few-shot examples) if you want to guide their behavior (Agency Swarm allows providing few-shot interactions , which can help e.g. Emotional Agent always reply with an emotion word, etc.). Essentially, this step sets the “personalities” and responsibilities within the system.

4. Implement Tools and APIs: Develop the toolset that agents will use to interact with memory and perform actions. This includes:

• Memory query tool: as discussed, a function or class that agents can call like search_memory(query) -> relevant_text. Under the hood it calls the vector DB query. (You may also implement a store_memory(text) tool if you want the agent to store new info on the fly – e.g. after a conversation, the agent could summarize and call store_memory to remember it).

• Knowledge graph query tool: e.g. query_knowledge(subject) -> fact_sheet. This might take an entity name and return a brief summary of what’s known (by running a graph query). Could also have add_knowledge(subject, relation, object) if you want the agent to record new facts.

• Communication tool: Agency Swarm provides SendMessage internally, but ensure each agent knows when to use it (this is via prompt engineering – e.g. Cognitive Agent’s prompt: “If you need emotional context, ask the EmotionalAgent.”). No coding needed for send_message beyond enabling async as we did.

• OctoTools planning tool: This is more abstract – essentially, you will integrate OctoTools by allowing the Cognitive agent to invoke a planner when needed. One way is to wrap OctoTools as a tool in Agency Swarm (so the agent can do a function-call like plan_and_execute(goal) which inside your code calls OctoTools’ planner and runs the plan). Alternatively, you run OctoTools outside of the LLM’s decision – for example, whenever a user asks a complex multi-step question, you intercept it in the orchestrator, feed it to OctoTools to get a result, and then give that result to the Cognitive agent as context or as a proposed solution.

Write and test each tool in isolation. For instance, call MemorySearchTool.run("sample query") in a dev console to see that it returns something sensible from your DB. This ensures the plumbing to external systems is correct before agents start using it.

5. Integrate LLM Models: Set up the connection to your language model for the agents. If using the MacBook’s local API, you might configure Agency Swarm like:

# .env file or environment variables

OPENAI_API_BASE=http://<macbook_ip>:8000/v1

OPENAI_API_KEY=none

OPENAI_API_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo  # or whatever model name the proxy expects

This tricks Agency Swarm into sending chat completions to your local server. If using HuggingFace directly, you might skip Agency Swarm’s built-in and call the model manually in your code (e.g. use transformers pipeline within the agent loop). OctoTools, when executing, will also need to call the LLM for planning steps – ensure it’s pointed to the same model (OctoTools might allow passing in a HuggingFace Pipeline or an OpenAI-like interface; according to their docs it’s model-agnostic). Test a simple prompt through the whole chain: e.g. have Cognitive agent respond to “Hello” and ensure the response comes back (this tests the model integration). Adjust model parameters if needed (max tokens, temperature, etc., which Agency Swarm lets you set in the agent config or via environment). Using smaller models might require more careful prompt tuning to keep them on track, so iterate on the prompts as needed.

  

6. Trial Runs and Iteration: Begin testing end-to-end scenarios. Start the Agency Swarm orchestrator (running the agency with your agents). Interact via a console or an API endpoint. For example, send a user message: “Hi, what’s the weather like? (Also, I lost my wallet today.)” This input might trigger the Sensory agent (if it was designed to parse inputs) or go straight to Cognitive. The Cognitive agent should ideally realize it doesn’t have weather info and use a web tool (if available) or politely say it cannot help with that (if not allowed), and it might consult the Emotional agent about the lost wallet part (triggering empathy). See if these flows happen as expected. You may find you need to refine: e.g., if the Emotional agent isn’t consulted when it should be, you might explicitly program the Cognitive agent prompt to always ask for emotion on user’s personal problems. If the memory retrieval isn’t being used, you might need to increase the system’s tendency by adding a reminder in the prompt like “You have a memory tool – use it to recall relevant info.” Basically, use these trials to fine-tune behavior. Check that the knowledge graph updates if new facts come up (maybe ask the agent to remember something new and later query it). Also, monitor performance: ensure each response comes in a reasonable time. If it’s slow, consider where the bottleneck is (model inference vs. memory DB) and optimize accordingly (e.g. reduce vector search count or use a smaller model, etc.).

7. Interface and Deployment: Once the system works in principle, deploy the user-facing interface and background operation:

• Backend service: Run the orchestrator in a persistent way. You might wrap it in a simple API server (Flask/FastAPI) with an endpoint that accepts user messages and returns the agent’s response. This way your iPhone or other clients can communicate easily. The orchestrator script could also handle long-running sessions (maintaining the conversation context per user). Since Agency Swarm keeps the conversation context internally (or you can store it in the vector DB as well), ensure that context doesn’t grow indefinitely – implement some history limit or summarization (similar to how AI Town summarizes and vector-stores old dialogue ).

• Mobile client: Create a Shortcut on iPhone that sends an HTTP POST to the orchestrator’s endpoint with speech-to-text transcription of your voice (iOS Shortcuts can do “Dictate text” and then “Get contents of URL”). On response, use the “Speak text” action. This would give you a Siri-like experience, entirely powered by your system. Alternatively, build a small app or use an existing messaging app to interface (even Telegram bots have been used to chat with local AI via a middleman).

• Continuous data integration: If you want the AI to continuously learn from new data (say you add new Obsidian notes or the user provides feedback), set up automation. For example, use n8n to watch a folder for new files or an RSS feed for articles, and when new data appears, have it call a small script that embeds and adds it to the vector DB and maybe notifies the Agency (the Knowledge Graph can also be updated here). This keeps the AI’s memory fresh without manual intervention.

• Monitoring: Deploy logging and perhaps an admin dashboard. You could use the Observability features of Agency Swarm or simply log to files. Monitor resource usage on the iMac – the Proxmox web UI is handy for that. If the memory usage of any container is too high, consider increasing its limit or optimizing the contained service.

8. Evaluation of the Hypothesis: Now that the system is running, evaluate if it indeed behaves like an integrated “digital personhood.” Does it exhibit coherent long-term memory (try asking it something, then referencing that later – see if it remembers via the vector store)? Can it reason over structured knowledge (ask a question that requires a multi-hop inference, see if it uses the KG or tools to answer)? Does the Emotional agent influence the tone (if you share bad news, does the response convey empathy)? These tests will validate the concept. Since all components are modular, you can improve each: for example, you might train a better emotion classifier model for the Emotional agent, or fine-tune the LLM on your own conversations to give it a more distinct personality. The open design allows iterative improvements.

  

By following this roadmap, you incrementally build up the system and ensure each part works before coupling them. It’s a complex integration, but each step uses accessible technology and open-source code.

  

Figure: High-level architecture of the digital personhood AI system. The Agency Swarm orchestrator (yellow) manages multiple sub-agents (blue and white nodes) running in parallel threads. The Cognitive Agent is the central planner that interacts with the user and coordinates with other agents. It uses OctoTools (gray) to plan complex tool usage, calling external APIs or database queries as needed. The Vector Memory DB and Knowledge Graph DB (bottom, in gold) provide long-term memory: the cognitive agent can query them (e.g. via a MemorySearch tool) to retrieve relevant past information or facts. The Emotional Agent runs concurrently, receiving context (e.g. messages about events) and replying with an emotional state or advice, which feeds into the cognitive agent’s decision-making (mimicking an emotional reflex loop). A Sensory Agent (if handling vision or audio) can similarly operate and feed processed input to the cognitive layer. All agents leverage a shared LLM model (here via an API, light gray) for natural language generation and understanding. The user’s queries and the system’s responses flow through the orchestrator, which ensures the right agents and tools are invoked. This integrated design demonstrates how open-source components can be composed into a life-like AI system, with decentralized cognition, long-term memory, and affective computing working in concert to emulate a “digital personhood.”

Here’s the quick rundown:

• What You’re Looking At:

The blueprint lays out a plan to build a digital “mind” by integrating two main memory systems—a vector database (for high-dimensional, fuzzy memory recall) and a knowledge graph (for precise, structured facts). On top of that, it uses a multi-agent orchestration framework (Agency Swarm combined with OctoTools) to manage several specialized agents (cognitive, emotional, sensory, etc.) that work concurrently and communicate asynchronously. The goal is to mimic aspects of human cognition (like memory, emotion, and perception) in a modular, containerized system that can run on accessible hardware.

• Why It’s Promising:

This approach leverages proven open-source tools. By separating memory storage, reasoning, and communication into distinct but interoperable modules, you get a system that’s flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain or upgrade over time. The design avoids a “hive mind” by containerizing each agent, meaning every component has its own isolated environment but still communicates fluidly. The use of open-source models from GitHub and HuggingFace ensures the system remains accessible and democratized.

• Implementation Difficulty:

This is an ambitious, multi-layered project. If you or your team are comfortable with:

• Containerization (Docker, LXC, Proxmox),

• Orchestrating distributed systems (asynchronous messaging, API integration),

• Integrating AI models and databases (vector DBs, knowledge graphs, LLMs),

then you’re in good shape. Expect the integration work to be moderately complex—it involves stitching together several advanced components. However, the modular design means you can develop, test, and refine each part independently before combining them into a full system.

• Bottom Line:

It’s a challenging but feasible project with significant potential. With careful planning and iterative testing, it could indeed form the foundation for a truly autonomous, “person-like” digital entity. The blueprint gives you a solid roadmap to follow and tweak based on real-world performance and feedback.

  

In short, it’s a robust approach that, while complex, is well within reach if you leverage the available open-source tools and allocate the necessary time to integrate and test everything properly.
