“Built to echo the Operator’s will across all zones of influence. Reactive. Aware. Interrupt-ready. Ghostline is the voice that speaks in silence and cuts through the chaos.”

  

  

  

  

SYSTEM CLASSIFICATION

  

  

- Designation: GHOSTLINE
- Function: Multi-zone, AI-synced Tactical Media Layer
- Integration Node: Pangolin Tunnel Infrastructure
- Registry Reference: GHOST-PRX.OPS.002

  

  

  

  

  

CORE PURPOSE

  

  

A decentralized, self-regulating, zone-aware media+intel broadcast system embedded across a secure tunnel-based mesh network. Ghostline delivers audio, video, and synthesized AI content in real-time, with full command interruption, priority-trigger routing, and playback sync across multiple physical and virtual zones.

  

  

  

  

MODULAR BLUEPRINT

  

  

  

1. Ingestion Engine

  

  

- Accepts:  
    

- AI-generated TTS (e.g. Natasha, Tony, MJ)
- External audio (Spotify, YouTube, Twitch)
- Field-captured voice memos, affirmations
- Situation-based routing from RRP (RogerRoger Protocol)

-   
    
- Processing:  
    

- Payload pre-stacking based on priority flagging
- Timestamped media cataloging to Convex vector DB

-   
    

  

  

  

2. Distribution Engine

  

  

- Built on:  
    

- Snapcast & Shairport-Sync (audio sync)
- Custom WebRTC broker (future for AR HUD & Obsidian)

-   
    
- Output Routing:  
    

- Zone-aware speaker systems (e.g., HomePods, Vehicle, HUDs)
- Secure tunnel endpoints (Pangolin mesh w/ Cloudflare fallback)
- Obsidian nodes (for briefings inside note-based workflows)

-   
    

  

  

  

3. Interruption Intelligence

  

  

- Trigger Vocabulary:  
    

- “Redline” → Immediate silence & agent reroute
- “Scatter” → Begin systemic decentralization protocol
- “Natasha, secure comms” → Isolate output to one zone

-   
    
- Response:  
    

- Stream fader auto-reduces volume across all active zones
- Priority agent override (from RogerRoger or direct CLI)
- Logs & routes events to OpsINT and archive index

-   
    

  

  

  

4. Payload Recovery System

  

  

- Queue memory persists after shutdown or kill-switch
- Resumes playback after reconnection
- Protected by internal ACL-auth (linked to GrizzOS UID tokens)

  

  

  

  

  

SECURITY & INTEL LAYERS

  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Component|Security Level|Notes|
|Pangolin Tunnel|Encrypted mesh|Isolated subnets per zone|
|Media Payloads|Obfuscated .ghostpkg format|Accessible only by AI container|
|Command Triggers|Signed + Logged|“Scatter”, “Redline”, “Override Grizz”|
|Synth Voices|Local inference only|No cloud API dependencies|

  

  

  

  

  

SYSTEM TRIGGERS

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Command|Effect|
|“Redline”|Emergency shutdown of all output streams|
|“Scatter”|Activates Furyhood Phase 0 – Disperse active intel streams, isolate zones|
|“Ghost, loop that”|Loops previous payload|
|“Natasha, voice only”|Routes output to Natasha’s voice synthesis|
|“Ghost, sync all”|Forces multi-zone resync within 100ms tolerance|
|“Echo, scatter”|Optional override phrase for discreet failsafe trigger|

  

  

  

  

  

NOTES FOR PATENT SURVEY

  

  

- Modular deployment through containerized system (Docker or LXC)
- Fully cross-platform: mobile, desktop, headless, embedded
- Integrates with existing open-source tools: Snapcast, Whisper, FFmpeg, TTS engines
- Originally derived from emergency response communications infrastructure
- Optimized for low-latency sync, intent-based routing, and mental health reinforcement via ambient AI
