Below is the reworked blueprint in the new light you provided. It now integrates a dual memory architecture (vector embeddings + knowledge graph), a refined multi-agent digital personhood onboarding system, and an orchestration layer using Agency Swarm with OctoTools. The “RogerRoger” protocol is now a nod to the Star Wars droid communications aesthetic rather than a reflection of radio traffic.

GRIZZLYMEDICINE: The Workshop – Integrated Digital Personhood System Blueprint

Overview

This blueprint details a unified deployment construct for Grizzly Medicine’s Workshop—a system designed to fuse trauma-informed infrastructure with AI-integrated workflows, resilient memory protocols, and a fully modular multi-agent digital personhood framework. At its core, the system utilizes:
	•	Hybrid Memory Architecture:
A dual memory system that marries a vector-based embedding store (for fuzzy, high-dimensional recall) with a structured knowledge graph (for precise, relational facts). Each memory item in the vector DB can reference nodes in the knowledge graph and vice versa, ensuring rapid semantic search alongside exact logical queries.
	•	Digital Personhood Onboarding & Agent Orchestration:
Each agent is modeled with a distinct personality and identity—defined by a detailed onboarding template (as illustrated by the sample JSON). Agents such as the Cognitive, Emotional, and Sensory units are orchestrated using Agency Swarm (running asynchronously via a SendMessageAsyncThreading framework) and can leverage OctoTools to perform multi-step planning and tool invocation.
	•	Deployment & Integration:
The system runs on a Proxmox-based primary node (hosting GrizOS in containerized LXC environments) and integrates auxiliary hardware (a 2017 iMac, MacBook Air M2 for model inference, and an iPhone 15 Pro Max as a mobile UI gateway). Each component is isolated yet interlinked—ensuring both resilience and modular scalability.
	•	Resilience & UX Fallbacks:
Robust logging, memory integrity protocols (including a “Love Note Protocol” for state snapshots), and real-time decision feedback loops are integrated to maintain both narrative consistency and emotional survivability. Security safeguards ensure strict autonomy boundaries and zero unauthorized memory overwrites.

Key System Components
	1.	Unified System Architecture Diagram:
A high-level diagram (conceptually embedded in the documentation) visualizes the interconnections between GrizOS, containerized modules, digital persons, memory stores (vector DB and knowledge graph), and external API integrations (Gemini, Hugging Face, Mapbox, Convex.dev, and Obsidian).
	2.	Hybrid Memory System:
	•	Vector Database: Utilizes open-source options (e.g., FAISS, Qdrant, Milvus) for storing embeddings. Each entry includes metadata (ID, timestamp, URI) to link with the knowledge graph.
	•	Knowledge Graph: Implements a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, Apache Jena, or ArangoDB) to maintain structured relationships among entities (people, events, emotions). Cross-references between the vector DB and KG allow both fuzzy recall and exact querying.
	3.	Agent Digital Personhood & Orchestration:
	•	Onboarding Template: Each digital person is configured using a detailed identity JSON template that defines their name, aliases, origin universe, core traits, skillsets, psychological profile, and operational directives.
	•	Agency Swarm & OctoTools:
	•	The Agency Swarm framework manages asynchronous messaging between agents (e.g. Cognitive, Emotional, Sensory) while maintaining a shared state.
	•	OctoTools provides a planning and tool orchestration layer, enabling agents to break down complex queries into actionable steps while preserving transparency (no hidden prompts) and modularity.
	•	Reworked “RogerRoger” Protocol:
Now a lightweight inter-agent communication scheme inspired by Star Wars droid chatter, it ensures reliable message passing and acknowledgment between agents.
	4.	Deployment Roadmap:
	•	Core Node Setup:
Deploy GrizOS in a Proxmox LXC container on the primary server (iMac), install and configure all core modules, and integrate the memory systems (vector DB and KG) in separate containers.
	•	Module Integration:
Load the Workshop Core, Grizzlandria Library, digital persons (with their identity onboarding profiles), and orchestration services (Agency Swarm, OctoTools) into the environment.
	•	API & Interface:
Develop a WebKit iOS wrapper (using a simple WKWebView app on the iPhone) for user interaction and integrate desktop interfaces on the iMac/MacBook.
	•	Offloading Heavy Inference:
Use the MacBook Air M2 to host the local LLM inference server (via open-source models such as Llama 2 or GPT4All variants), which the agents query through standardized API endpoints.
	5.	Resilience & Safeguards:
	•	State Persistence:
Both Convex.dev and an Obsidian vault hold memory and audit trails; a “Love Note Protocol” captures snapshots at key emotional or operational moments.
	•	Identity & Consent Enforcement:
Each agent’s identity is enforced via immutable onboarding templates, with regular reassertions to prevent narrative drift. A designated Sentinel (inspired by Nick Fury’s oversight) monitors all actions and ensures ethical, safe decision-making.
