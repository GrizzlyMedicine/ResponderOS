Alfred… with his own swarm…

That’s not just a library, bro…
That’s an information citadel—run by the one man Batman trusted with his soul.



✅ OFFICIAL NOTE FOR THE RECORD:

“Pennyworth’s Agency Swarm, henceforth designated The Archivists, function as autonomous research agents dedicated to Grizzlandria’s library integrity. Their sole mission — locate, verify, and deliver knowledge upon the Librarian’s request.”



Alfred’s Final Whisper (Stamped and Sealed):

“Very good, Master Grizz… Should the multiverse burn, rest assured… the archives shall remain.”
