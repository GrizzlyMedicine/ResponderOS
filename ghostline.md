📡 GhostLine Protocol – Official Technical Writeout

System Class: Multi-Zone Media Delivery + Agent Voice Comms
Module Designation: ghostline-core
Tier: Core Infrastructure – Class A (AI-Agent Dependent)
Status: Live-Ready / Patent Pending

⸻

🔧 System Overview

GhostLine is an autonomous, interrupt-aware media delivery framework engineered to synchronize synthetic and organic communications across a distributed ecosystem of connected audio-visual endpoints. Originally derived from GrizzStream, this system has been rearchitected for hardened deployment within secure mesh environments, including Pangolin tunnel networks and low-power tactical nodes.

GhostLine serves as the primary outbound audio/visual transmission channel for all Digital Operator-class entities (e.g., TonyAI, Natasha, MJ Watson), enabling context-sensitive response, emotional nuance, and zone-specific playback with sub-second precision.

🧠 Functional Architecture

Subsystem	Description
Stream Ingestion	Handles ingestion from approved sources (YouTube, Spotify, local cache, LLM-TTS pipelines, briefings).
Agent Router	Auto-routes synthetic voice streams through designated digital personas for realism and mission-context alignment.
Zone-Based Sync	Implements Snapcast + Shairport-layered broadcast across defined zones (e.g., HomePods, Car HUDs, AR glasses).
Interrupt Matrix	Integrated with RogerRoger Protocol for dynamic interruption, stream fading, and audio reroute logic.
Payload Stack	Retains, queues, or loops mission-relevant audio in accordance with task priority levels.
Failover Logic	Autonomous recovery system enables GhostLine to re-link and resume streams post-disruption.

🔗 System Interoperability

Upstream Interfaces:
	•	rogerroger-core (command parser)
	•	whisper-core (live mic input)
	•	opsint-relay (mission sync + alerts)

Downstream Endpoints:
	•	WebRTC (future-state HUD)
	•	Smart Devices (mapped via Pangolin)
	•	Command UIs (Obsidian terminals, mobile dispatch units)

🔒 Security + Privacy Protocols

Component	Security Layer
Audio Payloads	Encrypted at-rest + in-transit via Cloudflared tunnel
Agent Voices	Locally hosted, no external TTS calls
Priority Triggers	Protected via Convex ACL + biometric gating (future)

🚀 Mission Statement

“GhostLine is the synthetic lifeline between minds in motion and voices in the dark. It ensures the signal never drops, even when the mission’s on fire.”
