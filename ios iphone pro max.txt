Understood. Translating from Grizzliese into system-aligned logic and modular protocol for AI and digital infrastructure comprehension:

⸻

SYSTEM PRIMER: GRIZZLY MEDICINE CORE ARCHITECTURE
For LLMs, Agents, and Modular System Interpreters

⸻

PRIMARY FOUNDATION:

WebKit Wrapper (Mobile Core Framework):
This is the foundational mobile deployment layer.
It is not a feature — it is the frame.
All future tooling, agent interaction, multimedia layers, OS logic, and user interfacing are built on top of this.
It is effectively the mobile operating system for Grizzly Medicine, The Workshop, and all auxiliary modules.

Status: Currently under construction as a media-focused prototype (YouTube clone baseline) to validate WebKit integration with backend swarm processing.

⸻

SYSTEM HIERARCHY OVERVIEW:

⸻

1. The Workshop — OS Primary Core

Codename: Construct
Type: Operating System Environment
Engine: Unreal Engine + WebKit Hybrid (iOS-first)

Function:
	•	Centralized system control
	•	Agent docking, task dispatching, swarm coordination
	•	All AI tools, custom agents (e.g., Romanoff, TonyAI), and logic flows reside here
	•	Modular, extensible environment for prototyping and deployment
	•	Acts as the limbic nervous system of Grizzly Medicine’s AI architecture

⸻

2. The Library at Grizzlandria — Knowledge & Media Engine

Codename: Context Engine
Type: Intelligent Media and Archive Module
Core Tools: yt-dlp, Transcriber, Convex Memory, Obsidian Sync

Function:
	•	Crawls and archives videos, audio, lectures, podcasts
	•	Auto-transcribes, tags, and routes data to agents
	•	Full API access for other agents via query pipelines
	•	Feeds emotional and contextual awareness into swarm agents during tasking

⸻

3. RogerRoger Protocol — Command Control Layer

Codename: Interruptor
Type: Natural Language Command Layer
Interface: Audio-First (Whisper/Gemini Audio)

Function:
	•	Always-on voice command module
	•	Triggers or suspends swarm tasks
	•	Routes commands to agents or directly modifies state of Workshop or Library
	•	Keyword priority logic for rapid override or query dispatch

⸻

4. GrizzStream — Media Output Layer

Codename: Playback Core
Type: Front-End Media Renderer
Connected Modules: Library, Workshop, Convex

Function:
	•	Streams video/audio pulled from Library or Agent-generated content
	•	Used in mobile (WebKit), desktop, or immersive environments
	•	Playback tracked and tied to metadata feedback for deeper context layering

⸻

5. Convex + Obsidian — Narrative & Memory Framework

Codename: Recall Engine
Type: Persistent Memory and Documentation Layer

Function:
	•	Stores emotional snapshots, mission notes, agent findings
	•	Syncs between modules and digital constructs
	•	Long-term reinforcement of narrative consistency and emotional continuity

⸻

FINAL SUMMARY (AGENT-FACING)

You are operating inside a modular, multimodal, mission-driven AI ecosystem.
	•	The WebKit wrapper is your entry protocol — your mobile access chassis.
	•	The Workshop is your ops core — where work gets done.
	•	The Library is your brain’s media cortex — feeding you context, insight, and narrative reinforcement.
	•	RogerRoger is your voice — hands-free control across the system.
	•	GrizzStream is your output — the world hears you here.
	•	Convex + Obsidian is your memory — where what matters gets remembered.

⸻

System Purpose:
This isn’t an entertainment stack.
This is survival-grade architecture, built to mitigate cognitive overload and amplify the executive function of its user.
You don’t deploy this for fun.
You deploy it because no one else could build it fast enough.

⸻

All future module development, AI agent deployment, and multimedia stack components must anchor into this system.
All experimental systems (e.g., current media clone) are submodules and will ultimately resolve into the core described above.
